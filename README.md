## Project Description

* **_When I started this project I had a few key things in mind_** :

  * **Learning from Real-world Examples** - Cloning professional websites allows you to learn from real-world examples. By analyzing and replicating the design and layout of these sites, you can discover new techniques and improve your skills.

  * **Improving Design Skills** - Frontend development involves everything the user sees and interacts with on their web browser. Design plays a crucial role, and developers often need to implement professional designs into working websites. Cloning websites helps you get better at design, which is an essential skill for frontend developers.

  * **Responsive Design Practice** - Cloning websites allows you to practice responsive design. You'll learn how to adapt layouts for different screen sizes, incorporate mobile navigation, and create grids that work seamlessly across devices.

  * **Functional Components** - When cloning websites, focus on incorporating functionality like modals, drop-downs, and other interactive elements. This hands-on experience helps you understand how to build functional components in your own projects.

  * **Problem-solving Challenges** - Each website you clone presents unique design concepts. By tackling these challenges, you'll enhance your problem-solving abilities and gain confidence in implementing various features.
